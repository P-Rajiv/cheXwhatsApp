This repo contains code of evaluation metrics for the paper "CheXwhatsApp: A Dataset for Exploring Challenges in the Diagnosis of Chest X-rays
through Mobile Devices" with link https://cvpr.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/32580. 

Paper discusses the following challenges: 
As medical images transfered via whatsapp gets compressed to lower quality, CNN based medical image classification models show poor performance. Above metrics are designed to evaluate those differences both for classification and explainability techniques.

The metrics are 
1. LI-Score: 
2. OLS-Score: Measure how much the explainability map is outside the lung region. Explainability map is generated by Grad-Cam and lung region is created using lung-segmentation model. OLS = (heat_map intersection lung region)/ (heatmap pixels)
3. PI-Score: Measures how different are the predictions for original and compressed(by whatsapp) images are. PI_score = (number of images with different predictions)/(total number of images)
